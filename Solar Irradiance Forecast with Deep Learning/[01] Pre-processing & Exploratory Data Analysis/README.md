Preprocessing & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

📌 Project Overview

This project performs data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) for weather and solar radiation datasets. It includes:

Data cleaning and interpolation.

Solar geometry feature generation using pvlib.

Temporal feature extraction (Hour, Day, Month, Year, DOY).

Hourly resampling of time-series data.

A comprehensive set of visualizations:

Standard Line Graphs

Monthly Faceted Line Plots (Raw Hourly)

Monthly Faceted Line Plots (Daily Aggregated)

Data Distribution Histograms

Spearman Correlation Heatmap

Scatter Plots of sr_avg vs other variables

This script is structured for reproducibility and clarity, making it suitable for data analysis portfolios.

⚙️ How to Run

1️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn pvlib scipy

2️⃣ Prepare the Dataset

Place your dataset (Excel format) inside the data/ folder.

Ensure the datetime column is named Time and formatted as %d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S.

3️⃣ Run the Script

python [01]_preprocessing_and_eda.py

📊 Sample Visualizations

Below are some example outputs generated by the script:

1. Standard Line Graph

📝 Notes

Modify DATA_PATH in the script to point to your dataset.

Adjust years_sorted in the monthly plots section to your desired year range.

The color palette is set to a neon theme for better visual appeal.
