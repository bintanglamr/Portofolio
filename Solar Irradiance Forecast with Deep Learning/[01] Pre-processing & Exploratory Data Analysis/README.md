# **Preprocessing & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project**

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**

This project performs data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) for weather and solar radiation datasets. It includes:
* Data cleaning and interpolation.
* Solar geometry feature generation using pvlib.
* Temporal feature extraction (Hour, Day, Month, Year, DOY).
* Hourly resampling of time-series data.
* A comprehensive set of visualizations:
  1. Standard Line Graphs
  2. Monthly Faceted Line Plots (Raw Hourly)
  3. Monthly Faceted Line Plots (Daily Aggregated)
  4. Data Distribution Histograms
  5. Spearman Correlation Heatmap
  6. Scatter Plots of sr_avg vs other variables
